Read Notes in /folder/Notes.txt for web and docs backup!


This assumes you already have 2 shares on windows samba with names 

web_server_backup

and

linux_mint_docs_backup



For a shortcut sym link launcher add this

nemo /home/$USER/Documents/Scripts/LanBackup_Full/
or run ./shortcut.sh

where $USER is your username!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

More Notes:

Only warnings and errors will appare while backing up and restoring so dont expect to see every file.

Please also note:

Backup your permissions via perm_backup.sh after you backup the web files,
For example, order is setup run backup then perms backup!

Make sure you look in backup.sh file in web backup app and make sure it suites your setup for example it needs to remove old backup dirs first before a new backup can be run, this is to ensure files are updated and not ignored as they may already exist on the remote share!

It is your responsability to make sure all files have been backed up completely!
No symbolic links will be copied, and transfering inside an unsecure network may give hackers a peak at your files, this is a slim risk but this is up to you to check but, in any case, I do not accept any responsability for any loss or damges!
